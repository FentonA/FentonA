# Software Engineer

Backend-focused engineer with experience building web applications, APIs, and distributed systems. I enjoy working across the stack but gravitate toward backend architecture, databases, and infrastructure.

Rust is my language of choice for performance-critical systems and side projects—I've been writing it for 3+ years and appreciate its approach to memory safety and correctness. Professionally, I work with TypeScript and Rails building production applications.

Interested in distributed systems, observability, and developer tooling.
